4 (about 1 pound, total) boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded down to 1/2-inch thickness
3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
zest of 1/2 lemon
salt and fresh ground pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons butter, divided
3 cloves garlic, minced
2/3 cup low sodium chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons lemon juice, (adjust to taste - you may want less or more)
chopped fresh parsley, for garnish
lemon slices, for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

In a mixing bowl combine 1/3-cup parmesan cheese, garlic powder, basil, thyme, lemon zest, salt, and pepper.

Drizzle a bit of olive oil over each chicken breast and rub the prepared seasoning all around the chicken. You can also put the seasoning in a shallow dish and dredge the chicken breasts in it.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat; add oil and melt 1 tablespoon butter.
Once heated, add chicken and sear until golden, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue to cook for 5 more minutes, or until golden. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the chicken breasts.
Remove chicken from skillet; set aside and keep covered.
Melt remaining butter in the skillet.
Add garlic; lower heat to medium and cook for 20 seconds.
Whisk in chicken broth; whisk in cream and remaining Parmesan cheese; season with more salt and pepper, if desired, and stir until combined.

Continue to cook for about 2 minutes, or until thicker.
Whisk in the lemon juice and cook for 1 more minute.
Return chicken back into the pan; let simmer in the sauce for about 2 to 3 minutes, or until heated through.
Remove from heat; garnish with lemon slices and parsley.
Serve.
